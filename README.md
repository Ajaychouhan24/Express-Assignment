## 📁 Project Structure (MVC)

The project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern for clean separation of concerns:

- **Model** – Defines the structure of the user data using Mongoose (`userModel.js`).
- **View** – EJS templates render dynamic HTML pages (`login.ejs`, `home.ejs`, etc.).
- **Controller** – Handles logic and interactions between model and view (`controller.js`).

## 📦 Modules Used

### 1. **Express**
Used to create the backend server and define application routes. It handles HTTP requests and connects controllers to views.

### 2. **Mongoose**
Acts as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB. It defines schemas and performs database operations.

### 3. **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**
Templating engine to dynamically render HTML pages using server-side data like usernames, errors, and profile info.

### 4. **express-session**
Manages user sessions securely. It stores session data on the server and authenticates access to protected pages.

### 5. **bcrypt**
Used to hash user passwords during registration and validate them during login to ensure secure authentication.

### 6. **Bootstrap 5**
Provides a responsive, mobile-friendly, and visually appealing front-end interface with styled forms, tables, and alerts.
